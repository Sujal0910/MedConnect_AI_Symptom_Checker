**What is a minor burn?**
A minor burn (first-degree or mild second-degree) is one that is small (less than 3 inches), superficial, and does not cover a major joint or sensitive area like the face.

        Article(title="The Importance of Handwashing", category="Wellness", content_md="""
**Why is handwashing important?**
Handwashing is one of the easiest and most effective ways to prevent the spread of germs and stay healthy. Your hands touch many surfaces and can pick up germs, which can then be transferred to your eyes, nose, or mouth.

**When to Wash Your Hands**
- Before, during, and after preparing food
- Before eating
- After using the toilet
- After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing
- After touching garbage
- After touching an animal or animal waste

**How to Wash Your Hands**
1.  **Wet:** Wet your hands with clean, running water.
2.  **Lather:** Apply soap and lather your hands well. Be sure to get the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.
3.  **Scrub:** Scrub your hands for at least **20 seconds**. (A good timer is humming the "Happy Birthday" song twice.)
4.  **Rinse:** Rinse your hands well under clean, running water.
5.  **Dry:** Dry your hands using a clean towel or air dryer.

**Disclaimer:** This is general health advice. Handwashing is a key part of hygiene but does not replace other medical advice.
